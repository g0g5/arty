# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical bug in the text editor where user input at the cursor position is incorrectly appended to the end of the document instead of being inserted at the actual cursor location. The current implementation in `TextEditorPanel` uses a simplistic content change detection mechanism that only checks if content length increased, then unconditionally appends new content to the end of the document via `DocumentService.appendContent()`. This breaks the fundamental expectation of text editing behavior and makes the editor unusable for any editing operations that aren't strictly appending to the end of the file.

## Glossary

- **TextEditorPanel**: The React component that provides the user interface for editing text files, including the textarea element and content change handlers
- **DocumentService**: The singleton service class responsible for managing document state, content operations (append, replace, search), and file system interactions
- **Cursor Position**: The current location in the text where the user's text insertion point is located, represented by the textarea's selectionStart property
- **Content Synchronization**: The process of keeping the UI state (textarea content) and the service layer state (DocumentService content) consistent
- **Selection Range**: The start and end positions of selected text in the textarea, used to determine where content changes occur

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user editing a document, I want my text input to be inserted at the cursor position, so that I can edit any part of the document naturally

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types characters at any cursor position, THE TextEditorPanel SHALL insert the characters at that exact cursor position in the document
2. WHEN the user deletes characters at any cursor position, THE TextEditorPanel SHALL remove the characters at that exact cursor position in the document
3. WHEN the user pastes content at any cursor position, THE TextEditorPanel SHALL insert the pasted content at that exact cursor position in the document
4. WHEN the user selects text and types to replace it, THE TextEditorPanel SHALL replace the selected text with the new input at that position

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the DocumentService to support position-aware content operations, so that the service layer can handle cursor-based editing correctly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE DocumentService SHALL provide a method to insert content at a specific position in the document
2. THE DocumentService SHALL provide a method to delete content from a specific position range in the document
3. THE DocumentService SHALL provide a method to replace content at a specific position range in the document
4. WHEN any position-based content operation is performed, THE DocumentService SHALL validate that the position is within valid bounds (0 to content length)
5. WHEN any position-based content operation is performed, THE DocumentService SHALL emit a content_changed event with the updated content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user editing a document, I want the cursor position to be preserved after content updates, so that my editing flow is not interrupted

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is updated through DocumentService operations, THE TextEditorPanel SHALL restore the cursor position after the textarea re-renders
2. WHEN content is inserted at the cursor, THE TextEditorPanel SHALL position the cursor immediately after the inserted content
3. WHEN content is deleted at the cursor, THE TextEditorPanel SHALL position the cursor at the deletion point
4. WHEN selected text is replaced, THE TextEditorPanel SHALL position the cursor immediately after the replacement content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want proper content synchronization between UI and service layers, so that the system remains consistent and predictable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE TextEditorPanel SHALL track the cursor position before triggering DocumentService operations
2. THE TextEditorPanel SHALL calculate the exact content change (insertion, deletion, or replacement) based on cursor position and selection range
3. THE TextEditorPanel SHALL use the appropriate DocumentService method based on the type of content change detected
4. WHEN DocumentService emits a content_changed event, THE TextEditorPanel SHALL update the textarea content and restore the cursor position
5. THE TextEditorPanel SHALL handle edge cases where content changes occur while the component is updating (debouncing or queuing if necessary)
