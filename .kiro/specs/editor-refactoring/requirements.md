# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for refactoring the existing Chrome extension editor to improve tool clarity, architectural separation, and user experience. The refactoring focuses on simplifying the tool interface for better LLM interaction, decoupling document editing logic from UI components, and enhancing chat session management with history archival capabilities.

## Glossary

- **Extension**: The Chrome browser extension application
- **Tool**: A capability the agent can use to interact with documents and workspace
- **Document Service**: A background service that manages document operations (read, write, save)
- **Chat Panel**: The interface where users interact with the LLM agent
- **Chat Session**: A conversation thread between user and LLM agent
- **Chat History**: Archived conversation records from previous sessions
- **Active Document**: The currently opened document in the editor
- **Workspace**: A local folder opened by the user containing files to edit
- **Agent**: The LLM-powered assistant that can perform file operations
- **UI Component**: React components responsible for rendering user interface
- **Service Layer**: Background services that handle business logic and data management

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an LLM agent, I want simplified and clearly defined tools, so that I can accurately perform document operations without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Extension SHALL provide a "read" tool with no parameters that returns the complete content of the Active Document
2. THE Extension SHALL provide a "write" tool with one parameter (content) that appends new content to the end of the Active Document
3. THE Extension SHALL provide a "read_file" tool with one parameter (relative path) that returns the complete content of any file in the Workspace
4. THE Extension SHALL provide a "grep" tool with one parameter (regex pattern) that searches for content within the Active Document
5. THE Extension SHALL provide a "replace" tool with two parameters (target, new content) that replaces target content with new content in the Active Document
6. THE Extension SHALL provide an "ls" tool with no parameters that returns the complete Workspace file tree structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want document editing logic separated from UI components, so that the system has better maintainability and testability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Extension SHALL implement a Document Service that manages all document operations independently from UI components
2. THE Document Service SHALL handle reading, writing, and saving operations for the Active Document
3. THE Document Service SHALL maintain the current state of the Active Document in memory
4. THE Document Service SHALL emit state change events when document content is modified
5. THE UI Components SHALL subscribe to Document Service events and update the display accordingly
6. THE UI Components SHALL only be responsible for rendering document content and user interface elements
7. THE Document Service SHALL persist document changes to the file system when required

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to start new chat sessions easily, so that I can begin fresh conversations with the agent without previous context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chat Panel SHALL display a "New Chat" button in the interface
2. WHEN the user clicks the "New Chat" button, THE Extension SHALL archive the current Chat Session to Chat History
3. WHEN the user clicks the "New Chat" button, THE Extension SHALL clear all current messages from the active chat
4. WHEN the user clicks the "New Chat" button, THE Extension SHALL initialize a new empty Chat Session
5. THE Extension SHALL automatically generate a title for archived sessions using the first user message content
6. WHERE the first user message is longer than 50 characters, THE Extension SHALL truncate the title and append ellipsis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my previous conversations, so that I can review or continue past discussions with the agent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chat Panel SHALL display a "History" button in the interface
2. WHEN the user clicks the "History" button, THE Extension SHALL display a popup list of all archived Chat History records
3. THE Extension SHALL display each history record with its generated title based on the first user message
4. THE Extension SHALL allow users to select and restore a previous Chat Session from the history list
5. WHEN the user selects a history record, THE Extension SHALL load that Chat Session as the active conversation
6. THE Extension SHALL maintain Chat History records persistently across browser sessions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my chat history to be automatically managed, so that I don't lose important conversations while keeping the interface clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user closes the Editor interface, THE Extension SHALL automatically clear all current chat messages
2. THE Extension SHALL preserve Chat History records when the Editor interface is closed
3. THE Extension SHALL maintain the Document Service state independently from chat session lifecycle
4. THE Extension SHALL ensure that document operations continue to work correctly after chat sessions are cleared
5. THE Extension SHALL provide a clean slate for new conversations each time the Editor interface is opened

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool system to be more reliable, so that LLM agents can consistently perform the intended operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Extension SHALL ensure each tool has a single, well-defined purpose without ambiguity
2. THE Extension SHALL provide clear parameter specifications for each tool
3. THE Extension SHALL return consistent response formats from all tools
4. THE Extension SHALL handle tool execution errors gracefully with informative error messages
5. THE Extension SHALL validate tool parameters before execution
6. THE Extension SHALL ensure tools operate on the correct document context (Active Document vs. Workspace files)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system architecture to support better performance, so that document operations are fast and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Document Service SHALL cache document content in memory to avoid repeated file system reads
2. THE Extension SHALL minimize UI re-renders by using efficient state management patterns
3. THE Extension SHALL perform document operations asynchronously to avoid blocking the user interface
4. THE Extension SHALL provide loading indicators during long-running operations
5. THE Extension SHALL optimize file tree operations for large workspaces

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent service patterns, so that the codebase is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Extension SHALL implement the Document Service using the same patterns as the existing ChatSessionManager service
2. THE Extension SHALL use event-driven architecture for communication between services and UI components
3. THE Extension SHALL maintain separation of concerns between data management and presentation layers
4. THE Extension SHALL provide clear interfaces for service interactions
5. THE Extension SHALL ensure services can be tested independently from UI components
